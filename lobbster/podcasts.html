          <h3>Transcript</h3>

          <p>Welcome to Module 1: Helpful Definitions.</p>

          <p>
            This presentation is part of the Non-Profit’s Guide to Lobbying the
            New York State Legislature and Executive Branch. In this module, we
            will define and explain nonprofit organizations, advocacy, direct
            and grassroots lobbying, and common terminology used when groups
            want to engage in lobbying in New York State. This is the first of 5
            modules. This module is for informational purposes only. You should
            not rely on it as a substitute for, nor does it constitute, legal
            advice by a competent legal professional.
          </p>

          <p>
            This podcast, the other podcasts in this series, and the other
            materials available on this website are designed to provide general
            information about the laws and rules that affect organizations and
            individuals engaged in what is considered lobbying under New York
            law. What these materials help to explain is what sorts of
            obligations are imposed on non-profit organizations that engage in
            lobbying in New York State, with a focus on the reporting
            requirements that are imposed on those who do engage in such
            lobbying.
          </p>

          <p>
            As we discuss later in this podcast, this information does not
            relate to the separate and different obligations under federal law
            that impact a non-profit organization’s ability to engage in
            lobbying. This material is designed to help you understand what
            lobbying is under New York law and when the law requires groups
            engaged in such lobbying to submit reports to New York state
            officials about such lobbying.
          </p>

          <p>
            Please consult an attorney to understand your organization’s
            specific obligations. This information is not designed to provide
            tailored, individualized advice or guidance to any specific
            individual organization.
          </p>

          <p>Ok, let’s start with some basic definitions.</p>

          <br />

          <h3>NONPROFIT DEFINITION</h3>

          <p>
            The nonprofit sector is also known as the not-for-profit sector,
            civil society, the voluntary sector, the third sector, the
            independent sector, and the nongovernmental sector. This sector is
            characterized by three features:
          </p>

          <p>
            First, nonprofits do not coerce participation. They draw on a large
            reservoir of goodwill and demand nothing from the community.
          </p>

          <p>
            Second, nonprofits operate without distributing profits to
            stakeholders (this is also known as the non-distribution
            constraint). While corporations are able to distribute earnings to
            shareholders, nonprofit organizations cannot make such
            distributions. Rather, nonprofits must use all of the proceeds and
            income they receive for the advancement of the organization’s stated
            charitable purpose or mission.
          </p>

          <p>
            This constraint provides reassurance that the nonprofit’s mission
            takes precedence over the financial benefits that might accrue to
            anyone involved with the organization. Now, that is not to say that
            non-profits cannot pay their employees. Of course they can, but the
            salaries their employees earn must be directed towards serving the
            public, and not simply to benefit those employees or other
            individuals with ties to the organization.
          </p>

          <p>
            This nondistribution constraint also builds legitimacy and public
            confidence in a nonprofit. It provides assurance that the funds
            obtained by the organization are used for a public, NOT private,
            purpose.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lastly, nonprofits exist without simple and clear lines of ownership
            and accountability. Nonprofit organizations must serve many masters,
            none of which is ultimately able to exert complete control over the
            organization. Donors, clients, board members, employees, and local
            communities all have stakes, claims, and interests in the nonprofit
            organization, yet none of these parties can be clearly identified as
            the key ownership group.
          </p>

          <p>
            While there should generally be clear lines of communication and
            decision making authority within an organization, non-profits are
            accountable to many, including the federal and state governments,
            that oversee the operation of non-profits; and the community those
            non-profits serve.
          </p>

          <p>
            The largest category of tax-exempt organizations is the §501(c)
            organization, named for a section of the Internal Revenue Code. Most
            non-profits fall under sub-section 501(c)(3). If you truly operate a
            non-profit, this is the section that is most likely applicable to
            your organization. If you have any questions about what type of
            organization you are operating or want to operate, consult with an
            attorney to understand your organization type, or, if you are
            starting an organization, what type of organization you should form.
          </p>

          <p>
            The remainder of these podcasts will be focused on this specific
            type of nonprofit organization: the 501(c)(3). The IRS explains that
            section 501(c) grants exemption to 28 different kinds of
            organizations. But for our purposes, a “charities vs. everything
            else” distinction is very useful.
          </p>

          <p>
            In general, only charities exempt under section 501(c)(3) are
            eligible to receive additional major tax benefits. At some level,
            tax exemption for charities is tied to a concept that they are
            improving general public welfare.
          </p>

          <p>Now, let’s turn to some other definitions.</p>

          <br />

          <h3>ADVOCACY DEFINITION</h3>

          <p>
            Advocacy helps your nonprofit achieve its charitable mission. It
            includes making your voice heard regarding that mission, in ways
            like: Contacting your local elected officials; inviting these
            elected officials to meetings, informational sessions, and other
            events, and; creating a social media or email campaign to promote
            your mission. Advocacy is more about education and promotion than
            trying to change the law.
          </p>

          <p>
            Through advocacy efforts you can bring light to real community needs
            and highlight particular social issues that have previously been
            ignored by policymakers, thus raising awareness, and lower barriers
            to increase access to important services. For our purposes, it is
            important to distinguish advocacy from lobbying, which I will turn
            to next.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h3>LOBBYING DEFINITION</h3>

          <p>
            So now you must be wondering, what is lobbying? Lobbying is an
            attempt to influence government decision making. Here, I will focus
            on how that term is defined under New York Law. The IRS has a
            somewhat different definition for lobbying, and you should check
            with your attorney to assess whether you are engaging in activity
            that could jeopardize your status as a 501(c)(3) status under
            federal law if you engage in activity that 501(c)(3) organizations
            may not engage in.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can also consult the companion website to this website, which
            describes the restrictions surrounding non-profit lobbying under
            federal law.
          </p>

          <p>
            Under New York Law, an organization will be regarded as attempting
            to influence government decision making if it engages in an activity
            intended to support, oppose, modify, delay, expedite, or otherwise
            affect a 1-c(c) Lobbying Activity. These activities include: Passage
            or defeat of State or Local Legislation or Resolutions, adoption,
            issuance, rescission or modification of State or Local Executive
            Orders, or State or Local Rules or Regulations, rate making
            proceedings by a State Agency or municipality, procurement
            determinations determined or influenced by: (a) public officials or
            an entity working in conjunction with a public official; or, (b) an
            officer, employee, or entity working in conjunction with the unified
            court system in relation to government contracts, approval,
            disapproval, implementation or administration of tribal-state
            compacts, memoranda of understanding, or any other tribal-state
            agreements, or attempts to influence public officials.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once you’ve got that basic understanding of lobbying generally,
            here’s some additional definitions you will need to know as you work
            through these podcasts and the rest of the material on this website.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h3>DIRECT LOBBYING DEFINITION</h3>

          <p>
            Another important term under New York law is what is known as direct
            lobbying. Direct lobbying is defined as direct contact with a Public
            Official to attempt to influence an 1-1(c) lobbying activity or (ii)
            direct or preliminary contact with a Public Official to enable or
            facilitate an attempt to influence one of these activities.
          </p>

          <p>When does direct lobbying occur?</p>

          <p>
            Direct Lobbying occurs when an Organization has Direct Contact with
            a Public Official in an attempt to influence any 1-c(c) activity.
            This includes having Direct or Preliminary contact with a Public
            Official to facilitate an attempt to influence, such as scheduling a
            meeting with or making an introduction to a Public official, or
            having Direct Contact with any member of the Public Officials'
            staff.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can engage in direct lobbying even if the person who you are
            attempting to influence supports your cause.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h3>GRASSROOTS LOBBYING DEFINITION</h3>

          <p>
            Grassroots lobbying: defined as attempts to influence legislation by
            attempting to affect the opinion of the public with respect to the
            legislation and encouraging the audience to take action with respect
            to the legislation.
          </p>

          <p>
            When does grassroots lobbying occur? Grassroots lobbying occurs when
            an organization encourages others to influence legislation by urging
            those outside the organization to engage in lobbying.
          </p>

          <p>
            In order for an activity to count as grassroots lobbying, it must
            reference or otherwise implicate a 1-c(c) activity. For more
            information on what a 1-c(c) activity is again, reference the other
            materials on this website.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unlike direct lobbying, grassroots lobbying also requires the
            activity to include a “call to action,” in which the organization
            urges members of the public to deliver a message to a Public
            Official in support of the Organization.
          </p>

          <p>
            Just to recap, to engage in grassroots lobbying activity must
            reference or otherwise implicate an 1-c(c) activity, take a clear
            position on a government action, and include a call to action. all
            three elements must be met in order to go from merely educating the
            public to actively engaging in grassroots lobbying.
          </p>

          <h3>COMMON JARGON IN NYS LOBBYING</h3>

          <p>
            Now that we know what lobbying is, and the two main forms of
            lobbying, it’s important to know jargon used by lobbyists in New
            York State. Every industry has certain terms they use to refer to
            critical processes. These terms are known as jargon. In lobbying in
            New York State, particularly in the capital, common jargon includes:
          </p>

          <p>
            Legislative Office Building (LOB): where the senator’s and

          <h3>Transcript</h3>

          <p>Welcome to Module 2: Why might a nonprofit lobby?</p>

          <p>
            This presentation is part of the Non-Profit’s Guide to Lobbying the
            New York State Legislature and Executive Branch. This module will
            explain the reasons why nonprofits might consider engaging in
            lobbying, and is Module 2 of 5. This module is for informational
            purposes only. You should not rely on it as a substitute for, nor
            does it constitute, legal advice by a competent legal professional.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many nonprofits have learned that lobbying can be essential to the
            success of the organization in carrying out its mission. Many think
            of nonprofits and lobbying as oil and water (in that they don’t mix)
            …and if they do, it is through a legal loophole. But this is not
            correct -- even 501(c)(3)s, the most restricted type of tax-exempt
            charitable organization, may lobby under certain circumstances.
          </p>

          <p>
            In fact, some groups find that lobbying is VITAL to their ability to
            carry out their nonprofit mission. Many successful nonprofits not
            only provide services but also engage in advocacy efforts as well,
            which can sometimes include lobbying. Nonprofits in underserved
            communities may serve as a critical voice of the community in policy
            discussions and the legislative process, ensuring that policies and
            laws reflect the needs of the community.
          </p>

          <p>
            While there are certain restrictions on lobbying under federal law,
            and any nonprofit should always consult with an attorney prior to
            engaging in any lobbying activity, this podcast will explore when a
            group might consider engaging in such lobbying.
          </p>

          <p>
            In fact, given the number of pressing issues facing non-profits and
            the people they serve, it is more important than ever that
            non-profits consider whether they will become involved in the public
            policy debate and engage in lobbying provided the restrictions that
            govern their operation under the law will allow it.
          </p>

          <p>
            This podcast will not discuss those restrictions, but, instead, will
            explore some of the issues a group might want to consider when
            deciding whether to engage in lobbying (provided it speaks to its
            attorney before actually doing such lobbying!).
          </p>

          <br />

          <h3>WHAT ARE SOME THINGS LOBBYING CAN ACHIEVE?</h3>

          <p>
            Besides furthering the mission of an organization, lobbying can help
            a nonprofit survive and thrive. It can bring favorable media
            attention to an organization, which can lead to higher visibility
            and increased awareness of the organization’s mission.
          </p>

          <p>
            Nonprofit lobbying also helps a community solve problems. By
            increasing the visibility of a nonprofit organization, it can
            attract a large number of individuals from the community to learn
            about and support the organization’s cause.
          </p>

          <p>
            What is more, nonprofit lobbying helps give the community a
            nonprofit serves a strong voice. For members of the community,
            standing alone while taking a position contrary to powerful people
            with political clout and financial resources can be daunting.
            Nonprofits allow individuals to come together to give their voices
            more weight and counteract some of the clout opponents of the
            group’s mission may possess.
          </p>

          <p>
            All of this shows how important lobbying is – both to the community
            you are serving and to achieving your mission.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h3>WHERE TO START</h3>

          <p>
            So, should you decide that you want to engage in lobbying, and your
            lawyer says it’s okay to do so, where can you start?
          </p>

          <p>
            First, Start Small. You don’t need to immediately hire a lobbyist or
            drive to the state capital. Find a small coalition, or create your
            own small organization. Work towards your goal one step at a time.
          </p>

          <p>
            Next, Organize. It’s important to have a reliable group of
            passionate members to address clear, identified issues. Once you
            have done so, and you start to engage in lobbying, make sure you are
            tracking all of your lobbying activities.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lastly, Join Forces. Find other groups who have similar missions to
            you and join them to pursue your common goal. You will likely
            achieve more together.
          </p>

          <br />

          <br />

          <h3>WHAT ACTIVITY COUNTS AS LOBBYING IN NYS</h3>

          <p>First and foremost; what is considered lobbying in NYS?</p>

          <p>
            Under the NYS Lobbying Act, lobbying is defined as an attempt to
            influence government decision making. An organization attempts to
            influence government decision making if it engages in an activity
            intended to support, oppose, modify, delay, expedite, or otherwise
            affect a 1-c(c) Activity. These activities include:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Passage or defeat of State or Local Legislation or Resolutions
            </li>
            <li>
              Adoption, issuance, rescission or modification of State or Local
              Executive Orders, or State or Local Rules or Regulations,
            </li>
            <li>
              Rate making proceedings by a State Agency or municipality,
              procurement determinations determined or influenced by: (a) public
              officials or an entity working in conjunction with a public
              official; or, (b) an officer, employee, or entity working in
              conjunction with the unified court system in relation to
              government contracts
            </li>
            <li>
              Approval, disapproval, implementation or administration of
              tribal-state compacts, memoranda of understanding, or any other
              tribal-state agreements, or
            </li>
            <li>Attempts to influence public officials.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This is a much broader definition of lobbying than the IRS defines
            lobbying as. As a result, non-profits should be aware that some of
            their advocacy activity may need to be reported to NYS even if it
            does not need to be reported to the IRS.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h3>WHAT RESTRICTIONS DO NON-PROFITS LOBBYING IN NYS FACE?</h3>

          <p>
            NYS lobbying laws do not limit how much lobbying an organization,
            person, or entity may engage in. There is no set number of hours or
            a designated number of visits to the capitol or legislative offices
            that a non-profit group must be aware of as a non-profit. Instead,
            NYS requires the disclosure of lobbying activity if a $5,000
            expenditure threshold has been met, and in some limited
            circumstances even where spending is below $5,000.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h3>WHAT LOBBYING ACTIVITY NEEDS TO BE REPORTED IN NYS?</h3>

          <p>
            In addition to the definition of lobbying discussed earlier in this
            module , any work the organization does to prepare for public
            lobbying communications should be reported. This includes planning
            and strategy sessions and coordination meetings. It also includes
            work drafting legislation that does not yet exist, if the
            organization then pushes for that legislation to be enacted.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, holding a meeting to decide which policies to focus on
            for the upcoming year would likely not be lobbying until specific
            policies were identified, and the decision is made to pursue such a
            policy change by engaging with the legislature.
          </p>

          <p>
            Please note that a tool to help document and track your
            organization’s lobbying activities is provided on another page of
            this website.
          </p>

          <p>Welcome to Module 4: How can Nonprofits Lobby in NYS?</p>

          <p>
            This presentation is part of the Non-Profit’s Guide to Lobbying the
            New York State Legislature and Executive Branch. In this module, we
            will cover some important issues related to the ability of
            nonprofits to lobby in NYS, and is module 4 of 5. This podcast is
            for informational purposes only. It also only covers New York law
            and does not cover federal law, which also addresses some of these
            issues. Please consult an attorney for specific guidance on any
            questions related to your organization’s own planned or ongoing
            lobbying activities. You should not rely on it as a substitute for,
            nor does it constitute, legal advice by a competent legal
            professional.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h3>HOW CAN NON-PROFITS LOBBY IN NEW YORK STATE</h3>

          <p>
            As stated in module one, there are two main types of lobbying:
            grassroots and direct. As a quick recap, direct lobbying involves
            direct contact with a Public Official or a member of their staff in
            an attempt to influence what is known as a 1(c)(c) activity, whereas
            grassroots lobbying is an attempt to influence the public, and
            encouraging the public to take action, with respect to a specific
            1(c)(c) activity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Direct lobbying is the more traditional method for lobbying, while
            grassroots lobbying might be considered are more modern method for
            lobbying. Each one is an effective way to lobby, but choosing a
            method is critical in a non-profit's success for lobbying to achieve
            their goals.
          </p>

          <p>
            If a non-profit wants to influence legislation to fit its specific
            purpose, its leaders and members should consider a direct lobbying
            strategy. It is important to target the legislator or legislators
            who represent the district in which the organization operates, or
            where the organization has its headquarters.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once the proper legislator is identified, arrange a meeting or
            similar opportunity to engage directly with that individual or a
            member of his or her staff. During this meeting, discuss the
            specific piece of legislation that the organization would like to
            change and convey the organization’s position – whether it be in
            support or opposition.
          </p>

          <p>
            A recent example of successful direct lobbying in New York is that
            carried out by Planned Parenthood of New York. During the summer of
            2019, Planned Parenthood decided to turn down about $60 million in
            federal funding after the federal government placed what Planned
            Parenthood considered unreasonable expectations on recipients of
            federal family planning resources.
          </p>

          <p>
            Planned Parenthood engaged directly with New York State’s Governor
            and its local state elected officials, working tirelessly to secure
            additional funding through the state budget process, thereby
            avoiding any negative consequences for their refusal of Federal
            funds. This is a prime example of direct lobbying.
          </p>

          <p>
            If a non-profit wants to influence the public to act and use the
            public as a vehicle for change, it should use grassroots lobbying to
            do so. The public is the key element in grassroots lobbying and the
            public must be engaged to act either explicitly or implicitly by
            what is known as a “call to action”: for example, a request that
            members of the public contact a legislator in their district.
          </p>

          <p>
            One method to engage the public is through the use of social media,
            such as Facebook and Instagram, to inform the public of the
            non-profit's purpose and to urge members of the public to contact
            their local elected officials and influence them to support or
            oppose a piece of pending legislation. Successful grassroots
            lobbyists know their target—that is, the local elected
            official--well and are well-versed in how to engage the public to
            further their goals.
          </p>

          <p>
            We look again to the work of Planned Parenthood of New York for
            another example of a successful attempt at grassroots lobbying. In
            2018, supporters of Planned Parenthood paid a visit to Albany to
            lobby Gov. Andrew Cuomo and other elected officials to advocate for
            women’s rights. While some direct lobbying was initiated by Planned
            Parenthood, its leaders and organizers also brought with them more
            than 1,000 sexual and reproductive health advocates from around New
            York State in support of keeping what has come to be known as the
            Women’s Agenda in the state budget and funding the state’s family
            planning initiatives.
          </p>

          <p>
            By encouraging the public to come from all around the state to
            engage elected officials in the group’s lobbying efforts, Planned
            Parenthood was able to show legislators that their efforts helping
            women are supported by many people and organizations. These efforts
            ultimately led them to influence legislator’s thinking when drafting
            new bills concerning women’s reproductive health.
          </p>

          <p>
            In Module 3 we noted that NYS does not restrict the amount of
            lobbying in which an organization can participate. However, there is
            an important caveat that we’ll explain here. Under federal law,
            non-profits cannot dedicate the majority of their activities to
            lobbying, as opposed to the stated charitable mission of their
            501(c)(3), or they will risk losing their 501(c)(3) status. Please
            note that a tool to help document and track your organization’s
            lobbying activities in terms of federal requirements is provided on
            another page of this website.
          </p>

          <p>
            In conclusion, an organization may lobby through direct lobbying or
            grassroots lobbying, but there are restrictions imposed on such
            lobbying under federal law. Please consult an attorney familiar with
            these restrictions prior to engaging in any lobbying, even that
            which might be permissible under New York State law.

          <p>Welcome to Module 1: Helpful Definitions.</p>

          <p>
            This presentation is part of the Non-Profit’s Guide to Lobbying the
            New York State Legislature and Executive Branch. In this module, we
            will explain strategies for effectively lobbying the New York State
            Legislature and Executive Branch. This is the fifth and final
            module. This podcast is for informational purposes only. You should
            not rely on it as a substitute for, nor does it constitute, legal
            advice by a competent legal professional.

          <h3>STRATEGIES FOR EFFECTIVE LOBBYING</h3>

          <p>
            The first component of any effective lobbying strategy is: BE CLEAR
            ABOUT WHAT IT IS YOU ARE ASKING OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.
          </p>

          <p>
            The idea of distinguishing between different types of lobbying, like
            traditional vs. grassroots, and putting clear instructions about how
            to lobby on a media platform is helpful. For example, explicitly
            instruct your constituents to “Do X and contact Senator Y”. It’s
            important to be clear in your mission because the general public
            does not understand the subtle nuances of political lobbying – it’s
            all lobbying to them.
          </p>

          <p>
            But according to NYS legislators, there is a fundamental difference.
            Making sure your organization’s goals in engaging in lobbying are
            clear and that those you are lobbying understand what it is you are
            trying to achieve. And this leads to the second strategy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Second, HAVE A SPECIFIC ASK. Public officials don’t want to try and
            figure out what it is that you want them to do. Having a specific
            ask—that is, the thing you are “asking” the government official to
            do—is one of the most effective campaign strategies. Additionally,
            have a justification or rationale for this ask with talking points
            that a layperson is capable of expressing, with no lofty concepts
            that are difficult to explain or understand.
          </p>

          <p>
            Third, RESPECT THE ROLES OF LEGISLATORS AND OTHER GOVERNMENT
            OFFICIALS. Legislators want to get reelected – approach legislators
            as a constituent. Other government officials want to serve the
            public. For legislators in particular, having a hometown touch with
            their constituents is important. Make sure you thank them,
            personally, even just for meeting with them.
          </p>

          <p>
            With elected officials, it’s also good to thank them publicly on
            social media. Send out a tweet praising the legislator or other
            elected official for his or her help and the concern he or she
            expressed about your issue.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lastly, UNDERSTAND THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE. There is a list of slang
            terms that are used in the realm of New York State lobbying –
            familiarize yourself with them, so you’re not asking where to find
            “THE WELL.” Review Module 1: Definitions to learn more about these
            terms. Similarly, if you are seeking financial support for your
            organization when you are engaging in lobbying, try to familiarize
            yourself with potential funding and grant resources, and the
            restrictions that accompany them.
          </p>
