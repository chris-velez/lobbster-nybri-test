            <p>
              Hello. Thank you for taking the time to learn about how your
              organization can ensure it stays in compliance with New York State
              lobbying rules while advocating for your cause.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, the New York State Commission on Ethics and Lobbying in
              Government, or better known as COELIG, manages lobbying in NYS.
              COELIG’s existence is in jeopardy because a judge ruled the
              Commission’s creation was a violation of the separation of powers
              in government. Further, this ruling by the judge makes penalties
              and regulatory authority void. The Appellate courts have ruled
              that the Commission may still work while the litigation is pending
              a final determination.
            </p>
            <p>
              COELIG was established to replace JCOPE following a string of
              controversy around it’s arbitrary decision making. It was the
              intention of the legislature in making COELIG to create a more
              open and accessible governing agency tasked with regulating
              ethical standards of public officials and lobbyist’s.
            </p>
            <p>
              This tool is generally intended for use by 501(c)(3) non-profit
              organizations who are seeking guidance on lobbying regulations in
              the state of New York. Although primarily intended for
              non-profits, the information within the tool can be useful to
              anyone seeking to learn about petitioning the government in New
              York.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before you begin, we think it is helpful for you to know a little
              about how regulators view professional non-profit advocates and
              the organizations who employ them.
            </p>
            <p>
              The organization that implements lobbying regulations is called
              the COELIG. It is worth taking the time to view their website for
              more information after using this tool.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lobbying: communicating with a politician or public official in an
              attempt to influence legislative or administrative action.
            </p>
            <p>
              COELIG’s states that a “lobbyist" shall mean every person or
              organization retained, employed or designated by any client to
              engage in lobbying.
            </p>
            <p>
              If a person is acting as their organization’s official advocate,
              the organization is the Client. The term "client" shall mean every
              person or organization who retains, employs or designates any
              person or organization to carry on lobbying activities on behalf
              of such client.
            </p>
            <p>
              For purposes of non-profit organizations, The Lobbying Act applies
              to Lobbyists, Public Corporations, and Clients, including the
              individuals employed by them, who in any calendar year either
              reasonably anticipate incurring, expending, or receiving, or
              actually incur, expend, or receive more than $5,000 in combined
              Reportable Compensation and Reportable Expenses for Lobbying
              Activities on a State and/or Municipal level. COELIG further
              defines Lobbying compensation and Expenses; however, that
              definition is better left explained by continuing in this tool or
              reading the regulations.
            </p>
            <p>
              As an organization’s advocate, to COELIG, one is a Designated as
              Lobbyist for their Client employer organization. This preliminary
              information is important to helpful to understanding certain
              aspects of the tool; however, we understand that many who use this
              tool will neither be employed or designated by their organization
              as official advocates.
            </p>
            <p>
              To that point, we think this tool will be particularly helpful to
              those who are unsure of what lobbying is, when non-official
              advocates have to be identified as lobbyists, when lobbying has to
              be reported to COELIG, and other nuances surrounding advocating on
              behalf of 501(c)(3)’s.
            </p>
            <p>
              Again, thank you for taking the time to learn more about
              advocating in New York State. We hope this tool can be helpful to
              you and your organization!

            <p>
              New York State requires that non-profit organizations follow
              strict guidelines related to lobbying activities. If your
              organization attempts to influence certain types of governmental
              activities then you may be required to report on these activities.
              However, not all attempts to influence governmental activities
              will constitute lobbying for the sake of this discussion, so it is
              important to understand what activities that are covered under NYS
              law.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any attempt to influence the types of governmental activities
              listed on the screen is considered lobbying. These activities are
              known as 1-c(c) activities, and will be referred to in this way
              throughout the resources found on this site. We will now take a
              moment to explain each type of 1-c(c) activity in more detail.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any attempt to influence the passage or defeat of state or local
              legislation or resolutions is considered lobbying. At the state
              level this could include such items as gun-control laws, voting
              regulations or abortion laws. At the local level this could
              include such items as property-tax increases, salaries for paid
              government employees, or construction of new government buildings.
              These are just a few examples of state and local legislation.
              Generally speaking, if the government activity requires a vote,
              then it will be considered a 1-c(c) activity, and therefore any
              attempt to influence it will constitute lobbying and may need to
              be reported.
            </p>
            <p>
              Similarly, any attempt to influence the adoption, issuance,
              rescission or modification of state or local executive orders, or
              state and local rules or regulations, will constitute lobbying.
              These governmental activities generally do not require a vote, but
              an attempt to influence them will still constitute lobbying.
              Executive orders are issued by the executive of a particular
              governmental body such as the Governor, a County Executive, a
              Mayor, or a Town Supervisor. State or local rules and regulations
              are crafted by unelected governmental bodies such as the
              Department of Environmental Conservation, the Department of Labor,
              or the Department of Transportation. Any advocacy to adopt, issue,
              rescind or modify this type of governmental activity will
              constitute lobbying and may need to be reported.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many industries, most notably utility companies that are granted
              regional monopolies, must have any changes to their billing rates
              approved by state and/or local governmental bodies. Any attempt to
              influence these proceedings, such as advocating for the denial of
              a rate increase, is considered lobbying and may need to be
              reported when the proceedings are being conducted by a State
              Agency or Municipality.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any attempt to influence a purchasing decision made by, or
              influenced by, a public official or an entity working in
              conjunction with a public official is considered lobbying.
              Additionally, attempting to influence a purchasing decision made
              by an officer, employee or entity working with the unified court
              system in relation to a government contract is considered
              lobbying. These situations most often come up when an organization
              is attempting to secure a contract to sell goods or services to
              the government, or attempting to persuade the government to deny a
              contract with another party. Contacting a public official or
              someone close to the court system to assist in these efforts is
              considered lobbying and may need to be reported.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next 1-c(c) activity relates to relations between the state
              government and any of the recognized tribal authorities in New
              York. Any attempt to influence the approval, disapproval,
              implementation or administration of any tribal-state agreement,
              including compacts and memoranda of understanding, constitutes
              lobbying and may need to be reported.
            </p>
            <p>
              The last 1-c(c) activity that will be discussed in this section is
              a catchall. The code states broadly that any attempt to influence
              a public official is considered lobbying. Therefore, in addition
              to the specific 1-c(c) governmental activities already discussed,
              you must proceed with caution anytime you contact a public
              official in an attempt to influence the official on a particular
              matter.
            </p>
            <p>
              If there is a question about whether the activity you’re
              attempting to influence is a 1-c(c) activity, it is best to seek
              legal assistance from an attorney with lobbying experience in New
              York State.

            <p>
              “Based on your answer to the previous question it appears that you
              may be participating in one or more activities that could fall
              under 1-c(c) classification. Because of this, it is necessary to
              learn more about the two types of lobbying that exist; Direct and
              Grassroots. We will start with Direct Lobbying.
            </p>
            <p>
              Direct Lobbying occurs when an Organization has Direct Contact
              with a Public Official in an attempt to influence any 1-c(c)
              activity (discussed earlier (pop up). This includes having Direct
              or Preliminary contact with a Public Official to facilitate an
              attempt to influence, such as scheduling a meeting with or making
              an introduction to a Public official, or having Direct Contact
              with any member of the Public Officials’s staff. It’s important to
              note that you can engage in direct lobbying even if the person who
              you are attempting to influence supports your cause.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to fully understand what constitutes direct lobbying, we
              must first explain who the term “Public Official’ applies to. If
              the attempt to influence a 1-c(c) activity is not directed at a
              Public Official, based on the definition that we are about to
              discuss, then there is no direct lobbying.
            </p>
            <p>The term Public Official includes (pop up):</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The four statewide Elected Officials (pop up - the governor,
                lieutenant governor, comptroller or attorney general); members
                of the state legislature; state officers and employees
                including:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Heads of state departments and their deputies and
                    assistants;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Officers and employees of statewide elected officials;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Officers and employees of state departments, boards,
                    bureaus, divisions, commissions, councils or other state
                    agencies;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Members or directors of public authorities, other than
                    multi-state authorities, public benefit corporations and
                    commissions at least one of whose members is appointed by
                    the governor, and employees of such authorities,
                    corporations and commissions;
                  </li>
                  <li>Officers and employees of the legislature;</li>
                  <li>
                    Municipal officers and employees including an officer or
                    employee of a municipality
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Now that we have defined what a Public Official is, we must also
              define what constitutes Direct Contact.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the name implies, Direct Contact is any communication or
              interaction directed to a Public Official. Direct Contact can come
              in many forms including, but not limited to, verbal
              communications, written communications, electronic mail, social
              media communications, internet communications, attendance at a
              meeting with a Public Official, or presence on a phone call with a
              Public Official when the Public Official is aware of such
              presence.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another important issue to understand is Preliminary Contact. This
              occurs when a Lobbyist knows or has reason to know a Client will
              Attempt to Influence a Public Official and:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Schedules a meeting or phone call with the Public Official and a
                Client;
              </li>
              <li>Introduces a Client to a Public Official.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The rules around preliminary contacts apply even if the attempt to
              schedule a meeting or phone call, or to introduce a client to a
              Public Official, is directed at the staff of the Public Official.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, if these preliminary contacts activities are being
              carried out for purely administrative purposes, as opposed as an
              effort to influence 1-c(c) activities, then the activities are not
              considered direct lobbying.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, there are instances where meeting with Public
              Officials does not constitute Direct Lobbying. An Organization may
              attend a meeting with a Public Official simply to provide
              technical information or address technical questions.
              Organizations may attend a meeting to provide clerical or
              administrative assistance (including audio/visual, translation or
              interpretation, and sign language assistance). Organizations may
              also attend a meeting in order to observe it for educational
              purposes. When an Organization, or members of the Organization, do
              not play a role in the strategy, planning, messaging or other
              substantive aspects of an overall lobbying effort, neither the
              organization nor the individuals are engaged in Direct Lobbying.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, if an attempt to communicate is directed at a group for
              which a Public Official is incidentally a member, or it is
              intended for the general public, then it does not constitute
              Direct Lobbying. Some examples of this include an opinion piece
              published in a newspaper, a statement made to a reporter that is
              published or broadcast by a media outlet, a blog post, and
              attendance at a speech or public meetings.

              Direct Lobbying can also take place via social media channels such
              as Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. It is important to understand
              how to identify and account for these activities in order to stay
              in compliance with New York State law.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are three situations in which a social media message from
              your organization may be considered direct lobbying. First, if a
              social media message is sent DIRECTLY to a social media account
              known to be owned or controlled by a Public Official.
            </p>

              There are three situations in which a social media message from
              your organization may be considered direct lobbying. First, if a
              social media message is sent DIRECTLY to a social media account
              known to be owned or controlled by a Public Official.
            </p>
            <p>
              The last situation where a social media message from your
              organization would constitute lobbying is when it is targeted to a
              Public Official’s staff with knowledge that the person is a member
              of the Public Official’s staff.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your organization maintains a social media account and is
              communicating with Public Officials or their Staff in the manner
              described above, those activities will likely be considered
              lobbying under New York State Law.

            <p>
              Grassroots Lobbying is different than Direct Lobbying in that
              Grassroots Lobbying involves attempts to influence indirectly or
              through another. In most cases, this involves motivating or
              enabling the constituency (voters eligible to elect a given Public
              Official) to contact the Public Official in support of the
              Organization’s position. However, Grassroots Lobbying may take
              other forms that will be discussed below.
            </p>
            <p>
              A Grassroots Lobbyist is a person or organization who solicits
              another to deliver a message to a Public Official through
              Grassroots Communication. The audience or recipients of this
              communication voluntarily (and without compensation) then deliver
              the message to the Public Official.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order for an activity to be considered a Grassroots Lobbying
              Communication, it must: (1) Reference or otherwise implicate an
              1-c(c) activity (discussed earlier), (2) Take a clear position on
              a government action, and include (3) A Call to Action by the
              Organization, urging members of the public to deliver a message to
              a Public Official in support of the Organization.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is important to note here that Organization issuing the
              Grassroots Communication is considered Grassroots Lobbyist, but
              the audience or recipients that deliver the message to the Public
              Official are not Grassroots Lobbyists.
            </p>
            <p>
              A call to action can come in many forms. I will briefly explain
              those now, but you will also find a link for this information once
              the next question is presented to you. <br /><br />
              (i) A solicitation, exhortation, or encouragement to the public, a
              segment of the public, or an individual to:<br />
              (1) directly contact a Public Official; or <br />
              (2) solicit, exhort, or encourage others to directly contact a
              Public Official. To qualify as a Call to Action, the communication
              need not specify the form the contact must take;<br />
              (ii) The inclusion of an address, email address, website address,
              phone number or similar contact information for a Public Official
              even if the communication does not specifically exhort the public
              to contact the Public Official; or <br />
              (iii)The inclusion of a paper or electronic petition, text
              message, social media communication, or similar material (or
              electronic link to such petition or material) for the recipient to
              use to communicate with a Public Official even if the
              communication does not specifically exhort the public to use such
              material.

              Grassroots lobbying activity can take place through social media
              channels, and it is important that this activity is accounted for.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, a social media presence is required to engage in grassroots
              lobbying through social media. To qualify as grassroots lobbying,
              social media activity must satisfy three requirements, the first
              of which is that it must reference a 1 c(c) lobbying activity.
              Second, the communication must take a clear position on the
              action.
            </p>
            <p>Third, the communication must include a call to action.</p>
            <p>
              As a reminder, a call to action is a solicitation to the public or
              one person to directly contact a public official, or to have them
              solicit others to directly contact the official. A call to action
              could occur over social media when a public official’s contact
              information is included in a communication, even if the
              communication does not specifically ask for the public to make
              contact.
            </p>
            <p>
              Grassroots lobbying over social media could include messages, or
              communications that have attached papers or electronic petitions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Grassroots lobbying through social media takes place when these
              three requirements are met.

              Because lobbying activity can take place through social media
              channels, it is important that you do not overlook the social
              media activity of employees that may be attributable to your
              organization.
            </p>
            <p>
              For an individual’s social media activity to be attributable to an
              organization, a post or message must first have been made in the
              course of the person’s employment. Next, the post or message must
              have been part of a coordinated, mass social media campaign
              conducted by the organization.
            </p>
            <p>
              Employees are deemed to be individual lobbyists when both of these
              requirements are fulfilled. It is important to note that if
              employees are deemed individual lobbyists, the organization must
              designate them as such on its filings.

          <h2>Lobbying Days Information</h2>
          <p>
            Lobbying Days are an important tool used by many organizations to
            streamline their advocacy efforts and make more efficient use of
            their resources. This module will provide information on what
            exactly a lobbying day is and what information related to these
            events must be reported to New York State.
          </p>
          <h3>Lobby Days</h3>

            <p>
              When your organization participates in a lobby day, there are a
              few important points to keep in mind:
            </p>
            <p>
              First, let’s discuss employee participation. An employee's
              participation in a Lobby Day will qualify as direct lobbying such
              that an organization must identify them as an individual lobbyist
              on its filings when: The employee or designated lobbyist makes
              direct contact with a public official, AND Speaks on behalf of the
              organization. Both employees and designated lobbyists will be
              subjected to the same requirements. Additionally, an organization
              hosting a lobby day is not required to register volunteers or
              members of the organization as individual lobbyists.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next, you may have some questions about expenses from lobby days.
              All reportable expenses attributable to the lobby day should be
              reported. Reportable expenses can include, but are not limited to:
              Time spent by employees at the day itself (if the employees are
              compensated for this time), staff time spent planning the event,
              expenses related to placards, signs, t-shirts, and advocacy
              paraphernalia, transportation expenses (typically to and from the
              day). Additionally, all reportable lobby day activities should be
              assessed to evaluate if your organization has reached the $5,000
              reporting requirement limit. Information on this threshold is
              available in the section regarding reporting requirements.

          <h2>Restrictions on Events and Prohibitions on Gifts</h2>
          <p>
            As discussed throughout this resource, there are many rules and
            restrictions related to organizational lobbying. This module
            outlines two important sets of rules that not already addressed in
            previous modules; restrictions on events and prohibitions on gifts.

              A public official may accept complimentary attendance, including
              food and beverage, at your event if your event is (1) a Bona Fide
              Charitable Event or (2) a Bona Fide Political Event, (3) a Widely
              Attended Event, or, provided that certain conditions are
              satisfied, (4) an Informational Event.
            </p>
            <p>
              A Bona Fide Charitable Event is an event with a primary purpose of
              providing financial support to an organization that is either
              registered as a charity with the Attorney General’s Office (unless
              exempt) or qualified under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
              Revenue Code.
            </p>
            <p>
              A Bona Fide Political Event: An event with a primary purpose of
              providing financial support to a political organization or a
              candidate for public office.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before an event can be considered a A Widely Attended Event, FOUR
              conditions must be satisfied.<br /><br />
              (1) Complimentary admission must be offered by the sponsor of the
              event; <br />
              (2) 25 individuals who are not from your agency attend or are in
              good faith invited to attend; <br />
              (3) One of the following two criteria are met: <br />
              (a) The event is related to your official duties or
              responsibilities or allows you to perform a ceremonial function
              appropriate to your position; or, <br />
              (b) a speaker or attendee at the event addresses an issue of
              public interest or concern; and, <br />
              (4) You inform your Ethics Officer in writing of the Widely
              Attended Event before the event takes place.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is important to note that: Serving complimentary food and
              beverage at a Widely Attended Event will only be permissible if
              food and beverages are offered to all participants. Additionally,
              the exclusion does not cover entertainment, recreational, or
              sporting activity unless a presentation addressing the public
              interest or concern is delivered during the entertainment,
              recreational, or sporting activity.
            </p>
            <p>
              An Informational Event is an event, the primary purpose of which
              is to provide information about a subject related to a State
              officer or employee's official responsibilities. An official CAN
              accept travel reimbursement or payment for transportation, meals,
              and accommodations for attending, or serving as a panelist or
              speaker WHEN the following conditions are met: Such reimbursement
              or payment is made by a governmental entity or by a New York State
              accredited public or private institution of higher education that
              hosts the event on its campus; and, The State office or employee
              may accept lodging from an institution of higher education only:
              (a) at a location on or within close proximity to the host campus;
              and (b) for the night preceding and the nights of the days on
              which the individual actually attends the Informational Event.

              If your organization gives gifts, it is important to be able to
              determine what gifts are acceptable to give. Additionally, there
              are restrictions on whom you are allowed to give gifts to.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, you should note that state officers and employees are
              generally prohibited from accepting or soliciting gifts that are
              more than nominal value from individuals or entities that conduct
              business with the state. The many individuals that this rule
              covers include: Statewide elected officials, Legislative members
              and employees, Officers and employees of New York State
              departments, boards, bureaus, divisions, commissions, councils, or
              other State agencies (other than unpaid and per diem officers of
              such entities), and members, directors, and employees of New York
              State public authorities and public benefit corporations (other
              than unpaid and per diem members and directors of such entities).
              Also, gifts from “interested sources” are typically prohibited. An
              interested source is a person or entity that might wish to
              influence a decision made by the state officer or the state
              officer’s agency. Gifts from interested sources may be acceptable
              in situations when it is not reasonable to infer that the gift was
              (1) intended or expected to influence the official or (2) intended
              as a reward for official action.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although the JCOPE regulations do not specifically define nominal
              value, this category typically includes any item with a fair
              market value of fifteen dollars or less. If a gift is
              impermissible, it cannot be redirected to a spouse or child of the
              official, or to a charitable organization. Also, the official
              cannot accept multiple gifts from the same source if the
              collective value exceeds fifteen dollars. Overall, this
              restriction is in place to avoid creating the appearance of gifts
              being offered to either influence officials, or reward them for
              performing their public duties. A gift that is not from an
              interested source, and is less than nominal value is likely
              permissible unless it can be reasonably inferred that the gift was
              (1) intended or expected to influence the official or (2) intended
              as a reward for official action.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are some exceptions to the gift rule. If the acceptance does
              not create or give the impression of improper influence, or does
              not create an actual or apparent conflict of interest, it may be
              acceptable to give: awards or plaques in recognition of public
              service, honorary degrees, promotional items with no resale value,
              discounts available to the general public, gifts from family
              members and personal relationships where it is clear that the
              relationship is not being used as a pretext to give an otherwise
              impermissible gift, contributions to political campaigns, meals
              and beverages provided to participants at professional and
              educational programs, local travel payments for tours related to
              one's official activity, food or beverage valued at fifteen
              dollars or less per event, and complimentary attendance at certain
              events.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, if an item or service is valued at fifteen dollars or
              less, or falls into one of the exclusion categories, it can likely
              be accepted if it does not create an actual or apparent conflict
              of interest under Public Officer Law 74.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, it is important to note that some agencies may have
              different rules, therefore, you should speak to the Agency’s
              ethics officer about the Agency’s policies on the particular gift.
