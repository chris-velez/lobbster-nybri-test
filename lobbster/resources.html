          The following information comes from various lobbyists in Albany and
          governmental affairs lawyers who lobby on behalf of clients. This
          information could be useful for future lobbyists and people trying to
          go into lobbying.

          Compromise is part of the job, as is managing client expectations.
        </h2>
        <div class="section__content">
          <p class="section__item_content">
            A lobbyist must be able to compromise and be aware that the
            legislators might not give everything they ask for in a piece of
            legislation. This skill in lobbying involves client expectation
            management (if a lobbyist is lobbying on behalf of a specific
            client). The lobbyist must make the client aware that they may not
            receive everything they expected in a particular piece of
            legislation since compromises between lobbyists and different
            political factions alter legislation. Additionally, amendments to
            bills are made by legislators which can change what the client of
            the lobbyist wanted.

          <h2 class="section__subheading">
            Personal and professional integrity and relationship building are
            also critical to effective lobbying.
          </h2>
          <p class="section__item_content">
            Credibility and relationship building are critical in lobbying (this
            relates to the ethical obligations that lobbyists must follow).
            Lobbyists should make lawmakers aware of both the positive and
            negative sides to their issue or piece of legislation they are
            supporting (this is part of building a relationship with
            legislators). They need to make lawmakers aware of the negative side
            of their issue because the lawmaker has to weigh those sides when
            considering the right approach regarding any issue. Furthermore, if
            a lobbyist is not forthcoming with legislators and does not share
            the negative parts to their proposed law, the lobbyist will lose
            credibility with legislators on future issues.
          </p>
          <h2 class="section__subheading">Always look to build coalitions.</h2>
          <p class="section__item_content">
            Coalition building is also important for lobbyists since it allows
            separate associations to combine their efforts in passing
            legislation that relates to their respective organizations.
            Legislators will be more willing to consider legislation if a wide
            variety of organizations back the legislation. Coalition building
            also allows different organizations to collaborate on issues and
            address these issues in a holistic manner.
